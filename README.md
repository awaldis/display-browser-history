# display-browser-history

This repository contains the code for a Firefox browser extension that reads your browser history and organizes individual entries into web browsing "sessions" based on their proximity in time. The extension displays the start time, end time, duration of each session, and provides a more meaningful overview of your web browsing habits.

### Installation
