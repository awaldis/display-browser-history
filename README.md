# display-browser-history
A project that displays web browser history on a page within the browser.  This allows greater control of the history display than you would otherwise get with the built-in history viewer.  For example, I regularly review my browser history for time tracking purposes and it's easier to read when web page visits close in time are grouped together.  I also wanted to get some experience with web programming and Javascript.

This code needs to be installed as an extension and has only been developed for and tested with Firefox.
