# display-browser-history

This repository contains the code for a Firefox browser extension that reads your browser history and organizes individual entries into web browsing "sessions" based on their proximity in time. The extension displays the start time, end time, duration of each session, and provides a more meaningful overview of your web browsing habits.

### Installation

This extension is available on the Firefox Browser Add-On Marketplace here:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/browser-session-display

 Using the code in this repo, you can also install it as a temporary extension via [about:debugging](about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox). Select "manifest.json".

### Compatibility

This extension has been developed and tested exclusively with Firefox.
