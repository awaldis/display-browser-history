The Extension reads your existing Firefox browser history to organize
visited websites into sessions.

Default Behavior:
- No browsing history data is transmitted to external servers or stored
anywhere else outside your local Firefox browser environment. All
session creation and display happens locally on your device.

- Other than browsing history, no personal data, credentials, or other
private information is accessed by the Extension.

OPTIONAL Exception to Default Behavior:
- The "Fetch Favicons from Google" feature is disabled upon installation.
However, the user may choose to enable it in the Extension's Settings.
When the Fetch Favicons feature is enabled, the Extension sends requests
to Googleâ€™s favicon service for the icons associated with each website
in your history. These requests include the domain of the website in
question so Google can return the corresponding favicon.
- The "Fetch Favicons from Google" feature is included for aesthetic
purposes only.  The Extension is fully functional when it is disabled.
When it is disabled, no requests are sent to Google.
